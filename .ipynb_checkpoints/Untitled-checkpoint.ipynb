    "## Question Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson No. 1\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Why are successful cities dense, expensive, and with few large green patches?\n",
    "\n",
    "Successful cities are dense because of their growth in population. Successful cities attract companies and private households alike. This also results in rents becoming more expensive. Too many green patches are not efficient because they take too much space, still, cities need parks for keeping their attractiveness. \n",
    "A few remarkable, large green patches are not only recreation areas for citizens but can also become famous sights of the cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Why do cities need policy interventions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Interventions that classified in taxation, regulation, investment, information are necessary if a city wants to lead the city's developement in a specific direction. \n",
    "Some examples where cities should intervene are when less competetive land uses are driven out of a dense area because they are not seen as economically important or if dense areas produce clusters with side effects that can harm the developement of the city e.g. air pollution or crime or if there is not enough housing for the growing population of the city. Cities are also competing against each other and policy interventions that attract industries are also used.\n",

    "### Lesson No. 2\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. What is a spatial weights matrix, what assumptions does it make, and how is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The spatial weights matrix W does compute the neighborhood structure and formalizes it into something like a net. It basically shows the neighbors of one polygon or point on a surface. Because there are different ways to create a spacial weights matrix (e.g. Rook contiguity, Queen contiguity, euclidian distance,...) the spatial weights matrix is more or less an interpretation.\n",
    "The weights matrix is important for many different analyses exploring spatial problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. What is spatial clustering and what are the different kinds of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial clustering is a method for the analysis of spatial data for clusters of one or more variables. \n",
    "There is the test for a global spatial autocorrelation (e.g.Global Moran‚Äôs I statistic) which tests for clustering in the data as a whole but I can't tell you where the clusters are located.\n",
    "Local spatial autocorrelation does show the local clusters within a dataset but it doesn't show the clustering for the whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson No. 3\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. What is spatial regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial regression is the regression analysis of spatial data. A regression method is analyzing the correlation between two different variables. That means that the method is trying to explain a variable with another variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. What are the differences between the spatial error, spatial lag, and spatial Durbin models?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The spatial lag model includes a term that captures the endogenous effect of the neighborhood‚Äôs y on y. The spatial error model includes a term that captures the exogenous effect of the neighborhood‚Äôs X on y.\n",
    "The spatial Durbin model includes the endogenous and exogenous effects of the neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson No. 4\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. What is spatial non-stationarity in regression coefficients and how does geographically weighted regression address it?\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression coefficients vary with the different points/polygons. Mathmatically they are described as ùõΩ<sub>i</sub>. GWR is using a Gaussian weighted filter where the other locations are not set manually but mathmatically with this equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Can you give some examples of spatial non-stationarity in real- world phenomena?\n",
    "\n",
    "The effects of the average education level on income can vary in the European Union therefore it's an example for a spatial non-stationary behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson No. 5\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. How do cellular automata see and explain the world?\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic cellular automata does only see cells, states, neighborhoods and transition rules.\n",
    "Arranged in a n*k lattice, the cells are can have different states. If a neighbouring cell has a different state, the state of the cell is changed in the next step according to the transition rules. In urban planning cells are representing landspace and the two states are developed (built-in) and undeveloped (natural) land. Neighbourhoods are defined by the von-Neumann or Moore contiguity or a modification of those.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cellular automatas try to replicate the growth process of a city. If the CA can replicate the history of growth correctly, it is most likely that it can predict the future development, too. For a precise model the CA has to be adjusted because the environment is more complex. One approach is the SLEUTH-model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson No. 6\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. What are agent-based models and how do they differ from cellular automata?\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent-based models are used in more complex systems. Cells itself are not the main actor anymore. \n",
    "\n",
    "The new actor is seperated from the background and does interact with the background cells or other actors. \n",
    "There can be more than one kind of actor and they can have different rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10. What sort of point does Schelling‚Äôs segregation model make?\n",
    "\n",
    "Schelling's segregation model states that even slight preferences for neighborhoods of similar attributes can lead to a segregation into homogenous neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson No. 7\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 11. Does a fuzzy cognitive map represent a phenomenon or the perception of a phenomenon by a group of experts?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fuzzy cognitive maps create a what-if simulation that is representing a phenomenon. Because of it's ability for creating realistic simulations, fuzzy cognitive maps are currently a hot field for research.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12. In which cases the two above mentioned alternatives might converge?\n"
